## The Problem

*Local football leagues often juggle registrations, fixtures, player data, and prize payouts across spreadsheets, WhatsApp groups, and manual check‑ins. Managers struggle to keep squads updated, players don’t have a clear view of their stats, and organisers lack a central place to monitor tournaments in real time. The experience feels fragmented instead of professional.*

## The Solution

*CashCup is a UI concept designed for a Saudi football league to centralise league operations in a single product. The front‑end showcases how teams, players, events, and finances could live in one place... Complete with dashboards for admins, managers, and players, plus live match views and QR‑code check‑in flows. This project focuses on interaction design, layout, and UX for a future full‑stack tournament platform.*

## Key Features

- **Marketing Site** — Hero section with league stats, value proposition, and clear CTAs to browse tournaments or join as a player.
- **Events & Tournaments Page** — Card‑based layout for upcoming, ongoing, and completed tournaments with filters and key info (dates, prize pool, entry fee).
